If you use a 32 bit version of Windows, you will need to use GNS3 1.3.13 (or older). 32 bit support was dropped starting with GNS3 1.4.

:::note
If itâ€™s possible to update to a 64 bit version of Windows, we recommend to use the lastest GNS3 version if possible. Bugfixes and improved User Experience (UX) are continually being added.
