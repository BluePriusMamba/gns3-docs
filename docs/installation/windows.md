- Install prerequisite and optional software

## Supported Operating Systems

GNS3 supports the following Windows operating systems:

- Windows 7 SP1 (64 bit)
- Windows 8 (64 bit)
- Windows 10 (64 bit)
- Windows Server 2012 (64 bit)
- Windows Server 2016 (64 bit)

**Note**: The 32 bit version is not discussed in this guide. For 32-bit CPU or older operating systems, please read [this documentation](doc1.md).

## Minimum Requirements

The following are the minimum requirements for a Windows GNS3 environment:

| Item | Requirement |
| :------------- | :----------- |
| Operating System | Windows 7 (64 bit) or later |
